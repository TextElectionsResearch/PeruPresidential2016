## ABSTRACT:

Assuming people are more focused during the last weeks of political campaigns, we have collected different data in order to see how informative and relevant the messages are. We mainly analyze the speech of the candidates in a longitudinal way to detect consistency of their messages , the network of candidates and friends to confirm and validate political simmilarities, the differences, and topics, among their published plans and the discourse during the campaign and in different locations in the country. Findings suggest valid political ideology, different effectiveness in the use of different social media among candidates, a closer than expected plan of government, and a similar speech in every location visited.
